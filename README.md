🛍️ Vrinda Store – Data Introduction Summary 

The Vrinda Store dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer-level e-commerce transactions, capturing over 31,000 records of purchase history. It includes key entities such as customer profiles, order details, product attributes, and sales metrics. Each transaction is tied to a unique Order ID, while customers are tracked through a Cust ID, along with demographic details such as Gender and Age. The dataset further segments customers into TEENAGER, ADULT, and SENIOR age groups, offering insights into age-based buying patterns.

Orders are primarily delivered, with a small portion marked as Refunded, and are distributed across multiple sales channels, including Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho, Ajio, Nalli, and Others. Most of the transactions occurred in December, as indicated in the MONTH column. Products are uniquely identified by SKU, categorised into groups like Kurta, Set, Top, and Western Dress, and are available in sizes ranging from XS to 3XL, with the majority having a quantity of 1 per order.

The shipping information includes the city, state, and postal code, spanning major regions across India, such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and others. The dataset also includes a B2B flag, indicating whether the purchase was for business purposes. Notably, the majority of transactions are marked as B2C (FALSE), affirming a strong consumer-focused sales base.
